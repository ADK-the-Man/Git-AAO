# Git-AAO: Git Collaboration Simulation

This repository is used to simulate real-world Git workflows involving multiple collaborators, branching strategies, and conflict resolution.

## Features Practiced
- Git repository initialization
- Branching & feature development
- Pull requests & merge conflicts
- Remote collaboration (simulated users)
- Cleaning up branches

## Contributors (Simulated)
- Hema → Worked on `mainscreen.html`
- Dharani Kumar → Developed `signup.html` and modified `mainscreen.html`

## Branch Workflow
- `feature/signup` → Signup functionality
- `update/mainscreen` → UI changes to main screen

All changes were eventually merged into `master`.

## Git Tips Used
```bash
git push origin --delete branch-name   # Delete remote branch
git branch -d branch-name              # Delete local branch
